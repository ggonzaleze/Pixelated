Game done as a final project for programming class

Game Instructions:
The game starts with a 20x20 grid in which each square is of one random color of six: blue, red, grey, green, purple or yellow.
The objective is to make the grid of a single color. 
The initial figure starts from the top-left most square. Press the six colored boxes below the grid to change its color, 
and the figure will merge with the squares directly touching it that are of that same color.
